Simplification of Grammars,

All undesirable production rules of a grammar are removed by using the following steps:

	a) Removing Lambda productions
	b) Removing unit productions
	c) Removing useless productions

"Simplify.cpp" is a C++ code that removes the aforementioned operations from a grammar and produces a simplified version of it.


*Works only with context-free Grammars*
So make sure the grammar is of the form  A->x, where A E V and x E (V U T)*
V : Non-terminal
T: Terminal


There is a screenshot provided with the code. Do refer to them to understand how the input is like and how the code works. Thank you.
